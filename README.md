# NalinTiwary.github.io

This was a Project I worked on as an introduction to Front-end development. The website is coded in HTML and CSS with some of the animations utilizing JavaScript. The design theme is inspired by the trend of using deep purples and blues on dark backgrounds to create easy-on-the-eyes contrast.
